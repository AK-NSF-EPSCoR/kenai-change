# Kenai Environmental Change Interactive Sliders

These interactive sliders show environmental changes for the Kenai River watershed on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska.

The urban area and glacier extent borders were digitized by students at the University of Alaska Anchorage from 1950s historical aerial images and 2013 Quickbird satellite imagery.

The url for these sliders is published in:
